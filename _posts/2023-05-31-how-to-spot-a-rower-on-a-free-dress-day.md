As the rare sight of a free dress day passes, readers of *Unfocused* are left
puzzled as to whether rowing related merchandise is mandated for those that
partake.

Often seen walking in packs, rowers can normally be identified by their
distinctive quarter-zip jumpers, somewhat reminiscent of those worn by Canary
Wharf investment ~~wankers~~ bankers.  Studies conducted by our Chief Researcher
Kylie Van der Walt show that while it is unknown as to the level of power
associated with the jumper, it does not seem to be associated with increased
levels of academic achievement.  Observations of prospective rowing wags include
audible disappointment as yet another opportunity for a sniff of fashionability
is snubbed by the cult-like unspoken uniform requirements.

*Unfocused* reached out to men known as Plank, Spring, Budoo and Ginge for
comment, yet have not heard a response.
