The rig, dubbed *Peacewater Horizon*, exploded last night, leaving oil flowing
freely into the Indian Ocean.  The crew of *Peacewater Horizon* alerted the
authorities to an fiery explosion last night at 11:50pm, with the fire still
burning approximately 1000 nautical miles north west of Exmouth, between the

Australian territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos and Keeling Islands.
The crew have been rescued by the Mongolian coastguard, with it being understood
that they are mostly ex-employees of the school serving on ‘leave’.

The area in which the rig is located is understood to be a defence lease from
the Australian Government signed in 2014 by then PM Tony Abbott, with the
leaseholder listed as ‘Quaker Boatstoppers Ltd’ . The lease use was then changed
to include fast food, thought to have been host to a KFC rival named The Meating
House, however we are now aware that this was merely a front.
www.herbsandspicee.com did host the menu for this establishment, but has since
been dismantled. 

Questions are being asked about why the school was even operating the
previously-unknown oil-drilling rig. Phil Rogers will have questions asked of
his leadership after it was revealed he started a new job as the director of the
newly rebranded Friends’ Oil, Gas, Health and Fitness, replacing previous
director Mark McGowan. Phil mysteriously disappeared last week, however his
absence has been confirmed by FOGHF, confirming the suspicions of many. 

Friends’ Oil, Gas, Health and Fitness Chairman and school principal Nelson File
has not been seen in public since the spill, with protestors gathering outside
Pendle Hill, holding a light to the injustices served during this incident. 

Head of the Friends’ Oil Drillers Union, Martin Bowser, spoke to our
environmental reporter, Julian Wilson. 

WILSON: “Mr Bowser, it is understood that conditions upon *Peacewater Horizon*
were poor, with safety procedures often not followed. Did you ever feel safe
working upon the rig?”

BOWSER: “Well, ultimately after being kidnapped, blindfolded and shipped to the
middle of the ocean to work on an oil rig, the workers were often too scared to
raise our concerns with management. Posters of Nelson scattered on the wall with
text ‘Big Brother is watching you’ tend to keep us in line, however safety was
never seen as a priority.”

WILSON: “Interesting, do you think this disaster should spark change within the
organisation?”

BOWSER: “It is unlikely, although many of us are now hiding in the depths of a
jungle, in deserts, or in rural villages. Good luck finding us.”

After this line was muttered, four guards armed with no more than a copy of
*Advice and Queries* burst into Martin’s yurt and took both him and Julian away.
Julian was able to get this transcript to us, however his physical condition is
unknown. Please hold him in the light in his absence. 

Editor Blaine Stone spoke to employees in the Friends’ Gym, with one personal
trainer saying that he had to undergo a period of rostered drilling work, with
two week in the gym, then two weeks on the rig. While the PT was a fan of the
FIFO roster he enjoyed in his early twenties, affording him such luxuries as a
jet-ski and a LandCruiser, he thought the forced labour on the rig was
“absolutely f\*cked”. 

Quakers for climate justice were furious about the incident, and have since
increased the amount of signage around the school, raising questions around the
schools relationship with the Religious Society. 

*Unfocused* contacted Friends’ Oil, Gas, Health and Fitness for comment, however
they responded with a cease and desist notice and a large cash payment that we
have since donated to our bank account.
