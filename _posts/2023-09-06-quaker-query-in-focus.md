To begin this new series, we focus on quaker query number 19. We thought about
starting at one, but we like to SPICEE things up a little. 

An excerpt from the Advices and Queries [Australia Yearly Meeting, 2008]

Do you respect that of God in everyone though it may be expressed in unfamiliar
ways or be difficult to discern? Each of us has a particular experience of God
and each must find the way to be true to it. When words are strange or
disturbing to you, try to sense where they come from and what has nourished the
lives of others. Listen patiently and seek the truth which other people's
opinions may contain for you. Avoid hurtful criticism and provocative language.
Do not allow the strength of your convictions to betray you into making
statements or allegations that are unfair or untrue. Think it possible that you
may be mistaken.

Ah yes, “think it possible that you may be mistaken”. The political barb thrown
about in all official school arguments that fully embody the schools purpose and
concerns. The line that Adam has parked, waiting to ruin someones whole career
in a way that is Quakerly, yet may be argued to be letting his “convictions
…betray [him] into making statements or allegations that are unfair or untrue”.
Next week on QQIF, quaker query 13. In Peace, Günther.
