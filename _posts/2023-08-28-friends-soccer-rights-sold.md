With womens’ sport gaining record-breaking traction in Australia and across the
world, decisions today have been made to capitalise on this increased interest.
The Matildas broke television records with the semi-final against a few poms.
Luckily, the World Cup isn’t ‘coming home’, however home-town football heroes
have been awarded a new television deal. The Friends’ School Open Girls seconds
soccer team games will now be live-streamed in order to promote school
co-curriculars, according to the director of Sport, Peter Edinburgh-Beagle. He
said in a statement that “the school wanted to capitalise on the increased
economic activity surrounding sport and revenue from such events. Economic
success is the most important aspect of everything we do at Friends, however
this decision also means we can promote women in sports”

Responses have been varied, after Stacey Pryer anointed the team the honour of
being ‘like the Matildas’. We feel this may be unkind to the Matildas, given
their success and the current low ranking of the Friends Team, however time will
tell.

Stay tuned, going into extra time.
