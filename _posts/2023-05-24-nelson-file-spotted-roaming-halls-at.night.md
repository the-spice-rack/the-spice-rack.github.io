Tragedy has struck the halls as Principal File was allegedly seen roaming the halls of S-Block at 1:00 AM on the 17th of May. 

"I've never seen anything like it. He was mumbling to himself about space and rowing funding. I out to him to ask if he was okay, one high pitched scream later and he vanished," stated a cleaner who wished to remain anonymous. Fellow janitor and amateur writer Claire Burgenstein claimed, "his feet gently brushed the carpeted floors as he floated through the classrooms, a soft yet fierce aura radiated from him." These claims have yet to be verified by any authorities specialising in paranormal events. Still, it is advised that citizens avoid the school during power outages and full moons, as well as hang garlic above doors and travel in packs.

For a school regarded as fraught with scandals involving eldritch horrors and ghoulish creatures, this represents a crushing blow to its reputation. A representative of the school stated, "BEWARE THOSE THAT CHALLENGE NELSONS REIGN FOR HE FEASTS TONIGHT". The meaning of this statement is still unclear. 

Whether the school is soft on poltergeists or progressive in its approach to the metaphysical is hotly debated, but one thing is for sure: we can't expect it to stop anytime soon. Expect updates from *Unfocused* soon.
