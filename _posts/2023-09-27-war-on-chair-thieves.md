excerpt: Brandon cracks down on illegal chair sales
---

After a spree of chairs reported missing, Farrell Centre director Brandon van
der Broek has decided enough is enough. In recent times, more than 40 chairs
have been listed on online trading hub Facebook Marketplace. One even sold for
$35,000 at a Sothebys Auction after it was revealed that Nelson File fell asleep
in it. However, with stocks of chairs dwindling and gathering becoming
increasingly cramped, Brandon has decided to take matters into his own hands.
Beneath the long flowing trench coat gleams a can of pepper spray and a pair of
pink fluffy handcuffs; these are the only two methods of constraint allowed
under the Farrell Centre Quaker Guidelines. However, *Unfocused* can report that
conceded in the boot of his car is a brand new Kalashnikov automatic rifle, with
any suspected chair thieves shot as soon as they reach the lawless realm of Boa
Vista. Since this armament, no chairs have been stolen from the Farrell Centre.
However worldwide chair supply is coordinated by Australia Post, so any
replacement chairs will likely be delayed by between 3 and 100 business days
under AusPostâ€™s express shipping guidelines.

Will we see the outbreak of a chair war? Or will Brandon's threats keep the
rascals at bay? More to come.
