After a [catastrophic incident earlier in the
year](https://unfocused.page/2023/06/16/friends-school-oil-rig-explodes.html),
FOGHF are back at their old tricks again, nabbing unsuspecting staff from the
classrooms of Clemes. Peter Appleton is the latest victim, with a suspicious
period of ‘leave’, suspected to be serving disciplinary sentence working on the
oil rig. Reports suggest his room has no windows and plays only footage of
Liverpool walloping his Manchester United 7-0 this year. Under the UN Convention
of Safe Hostage Retention, this is considered torture, however the offshore
nature of the rig leads to questions being asked about who is responsible for
this breach in international law. Bird life in the oceanic region is understood
to be lacking, with Peter’s binoculars and camera lenses smashed upon entry in a
display of power from Officer of Rig Control and Security Johaan Popolious.

Peter is expected to return before Carlton’s first home final in 12 years. More
to follow.
