Somebody decided to have another one of those baked goods things in the foyer.
Good for them, we guess.

"I don't know what charity this is for, or what they do," said a student that we
spoke to, "but I'll be damned if I don't empty my wallet for some baked goods."
As we were tapping our phone on that weird little white square, we asked the
people running the event what motivated them to raise money for the (presumably)
good cause. "Well, we really care about this super important issue, and also (as
a little side note) we hadn't organised our tutor service activity yet," said
someone on the other side of the trestle table.

At press time, the entire staff of the *Unfocused* was seen fighting over the
last cupcake in their office. We apologise for forgetting to ask what the bake
sale's charity was.
