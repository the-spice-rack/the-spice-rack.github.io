Recently the school has been educating students about finances, here at
*Unfocused*, we know a thing or two about money making as well. So without
further ado, let's get into some tips.

## 1. Compound Interest.

Let's say, for the sake of easy numbers, you make \$10,000 AUD a year after
taxes. The average person may invest 5% of their income in a bank returning 3%
annually, this will return a total of \$1,986.00 after ten years. Not bad, but
we can do better. Say you invest 85% of your income in an account returning 65%
interest, you would earn \$91,649,125.58. 

Work smarter, not harder. 

## 2. Beg for Bus Money.

It may seem pathetic, but it adds up. Let's say you make 4 dollars a week from
begging for bus money, over all 52 weeks in a year, thats an extra 67,000
dollars per year. 

## 3. Invest in Stock.

Firstly, utilize quantitative models like discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to
evaluate a company's intrinsic value. Combine this with a qualitative assessment
of factors such as competitive positioning and management competence to form a
comprehensive investment thesis. Secondly, employ risk management techniques,
such as options strategies or hedging instruments, to safeguard your portfolio
against market volatility. Diversify your holdings across different industries
to mitigate risk and enhance potential returns. Additionally, stay abreast of
macroeconomic trends, geopolitical developments, and market sentiment to
identify emerging opportunities and capitalize on market inefficiencies. Lastly,
maintain a long-term perspective and remain resilient in the face of short-term
market fluctuations. Remember, successful stock investments require a
multifaceted approach that incorporates advanced financial tools, insightful
analysis, and an understanding of the broader market landscape.

## 4. Eat a Twin in Uetero

A second person can help money making immensly. Here's some ideas:

- Collect unemployment benefits. You're techinically two people and one of them
  isn't working! You're entitled to it.

- Use it as a tax writeoff. Transfer your money to your missing twin so you
  technically have no income, thus, no taxes.

- Transfer power of your body to your twin as you sleep. Working 24/7 can boost
  your productivity through the roof. 

The possibilities are endless. 

## 5. Buy UnfocusedCoin
