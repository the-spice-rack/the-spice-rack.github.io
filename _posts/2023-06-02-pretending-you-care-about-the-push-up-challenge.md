Oh no! You've been questioned about the pushup challenge! Your tutor, a friend, or a complete stranger has challenged your claim to averaging 50 pushups a day. At this point, it's over, we know what path this will go down. You'll do everything in your power to avoid it but it ends with your noodle arms giving out after three example pushups. 

So, without further ado, let's look into some ways to avoid this situation in the first place.

## 1. Confidence
**Confidence is key; and those obnoxious pushers can smell it on you.**

They smell your weak will, your shrimpy arms, your lousy core. Both you and I know we don't have the endurance to get through a whole set, let's keep that between us. Stand upright. Puff your chest out. 
**DON'T LET THEM KNOW.**

## 2. Overcompensate

**It's a mock or be mocked world.**

Try sprinkling into conversation how dedicated you are. Consider mentioning how much your chest hurts, maybe make up a fun anecdote about how someone walked in on you doing your pushups. Make it believable but unverifiable. Don't forget to whinge about how others lie about doing pushups, make them think you're one of them. 

***Remember:* Don't lay it on too thick, you'll make them suspicious.**

## 3. Donate for your Tutor. 

**If it doesn't get them off your trail it will at least ease your conscience!**

Here's what you do: as soon as pushups are mentioned, bring up how much money you've raised. If someone questions you, bring up how much money you've raised. Hell, if someone else talks about donating: bring up how much money you've raised. It may make you sound like an obnoxious and self centered prick, but it's better than being exposed as the fraud that you are. 

***Bonus Tip:* Donate to yourself anonymously, makes it look even better!**

## 4. Fake an Injury

**It may sound immoral, but it's a get out of jail free card.**

Faking an injury is the ultimate way to avoid confrontation. Pick something that you don't have to spend the whole day faking. A bum leg may seem like a good idea to start, but walking around like you need to poop can be more embarrassing than getting exposed as a fraud. Worst of all, if you drop the act then you're the laughing stock of the school. Faking an injury to avoid some measly pushups? Pathetic.

My go to is a shoulder injury, it's a good non-specific symptom that you don't constantly have to fake. Give it a try next time some snotty try-hard asks why you haven't reached your daily goal. 

## 5. The Last Resort. 

**It sucks, but you might have to actually do pushups.**

Admit it. You're soft. Atone for the sins of sloth and gluttony that consume you, the only calluses your hands will ever know come from that of a rowing oar. Endless hours of mind numbing scrolling and melting into couches has atrophied your brain and muscles into pudding. But if the pressures too much, you may have to do some pushups. 

## 6. The Last, Last Resort.

**Kill a family member, grief is a powerful thing.**

If worst comes to worst a dead grandma or aunt can save your skin. Shed a few
tears and those filthy pusheruperers will leave you alone...for now. 

This has been *Unfocused*. Stay safe. Stay vigilant. Survive.
