The editors of the world's premiere newspaper would like to apologise for not
publishing more articles. Since the re-opening of the boys' bathroom, we have
been forced to re-locate our office space. "Have you ever tried to carry a
printing press? They're bloody heavy!", said co-editor Matty Gruber. In other,
unrelated news, schoolwork is pretty crazy at the moment. "We are, of course,
still accepting article submissions," said senior writer Monsieur de Sirloin,
"you can email us at mdesirloin@unfocused.page, mgruber@unfocused.page,
bstone@unfocused.page, and editor@unfocused.page".
