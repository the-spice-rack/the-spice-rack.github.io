After another stunning timing blunder from the Y12 representatives, a Google
Drive album has been distributed asking year twelves to take time out of their
day to uncover semi-incriminating photos of their friends to laugh at.
Unfortunately for the Clemes Council, mid-year exams begin in just over a week,
and people are somewhat preoccupied. The collective ignorance of the email has
been stunning, with only one image submitted to the folder, highlighting the
intense commitment that students have to study (or just not checking their
emails).  Surprisingly, notorious instagramming mothers known under the
pseudonymous entity of @milfs.af have not contributed to the album, with their
extensive collection of photos currently confined to their instagram account,
however many are worried as to what photos may appear as a result of the
involvement of these infamous maternal influencers. 

We requested to follow @clemescouncil but they have not approved said request,
therefore we were unable to gain a comment on the matter.

More to follow.
