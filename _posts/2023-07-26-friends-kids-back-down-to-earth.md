After two weeks of Euro summer, some Friends' students are this week forced back
into the sweaty cavern that is Clemes. With few days until ‘mid year’ exams
(that take place in August, with the school year 75% done), many are feeling
somewhat overwhelmed. The reality of Mediterranean sun tanning and a lunchtime
aperol spritz begin to fade for year 12 student Miranda, as she struggles to
come to terms with the impending examination domination situation that is
consecutive Maths Specialised, Physics, Chemistry and Sports Science exams. She
described this as ‘absolutely f\*cked’.  We agree, yet struggle to sympathise
after achieving below par ATARs and passing our undergraduate journalism degrees
with an average GPA of 4.56. While we now have largely successful careers in a
lucrative industry (satire), Miranda does not feel as confident in her life
choices. She aspires to study law at the University of Sydney, a course reserved
for Kings College boys, polo boys and international students with deep pockets,
otherwise described by intern Harvey Lonergan-Sykes as ‘an absolute sausage
fest’ who are also ‘massive wankers’.  Jane Morrison was seen cackling to
herself this morning after yet another student was overheard whinging about
exams, leading to claims of purposefully demonic behaviour from the Clemes
leadership group. We contacted the school for comment, however we received four
consecutive emails with the same study planner and recycled advice attached.

More to come.
