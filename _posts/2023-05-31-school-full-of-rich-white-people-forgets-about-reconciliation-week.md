News from the hallways: privileged, white dominated school forgets about
Reconciliation Week.

Reconciliation Week is an Australia wide week of indigenous history and culture
celebration and reconciliation discussion. The week, which runs over two weeks,
was first observed in 1993, roughly the same time Adam Chambers was a student at
Clemes. In an unsurprising bout of ignorance of Australiaâ€™s first people, the
school has neglected to mention the intensely important week of indigenous
reconciliation until the Tuesday, three days after the week had begun.

This is unfortunately not the first time the school has forgotten they have a
social responsibility, with many school events forgetting a basic acknowledgment
of country, something adopted by even the worst factions of the Liberal/National
Coalition.  It seems that the rest of the week will not include any more
recognition, with pathways advice taking priority, reaffirming the schools
agenda of getting rich white kids into JCU Med instead of taking reconciliatory
action.

Unfocused did not receive a statement from the schools indigenous spokesperson,
as no such person exists.
