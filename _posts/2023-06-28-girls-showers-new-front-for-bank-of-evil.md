Chaos has erupted as it was today discovered that the home of villainous venture
valuation and (in)vestment, the Bank of Evil, is contained within the girls
showers at Clemes. It is understood that the covert financial firm has been
lurking in the depths of the school for over a decade, with multiple sightings
of CEO Mr Perkins. Nelson File is understood to be a childhood friend of
Perkins, with son and accused moon thief Victor graduating in the class of 2017. 

A mountain of a man was spotted walking into the toilets yesterday,
characterised by his long nose, shiny head and striped scarf, briefcase and
blueprints in hand. While this raised eyebrows, no words were spoken to our
roving reporter and intern Harvey Lonergan-Sykes. This disheartened Harvey,
however he did speak to some smaller yellow creatures outside Clemes today,
after they robbed the Friends’ canteen, taking all the banana bread in sight.
Unfortunately, Harvey couldn't understand a word they said.

The Bank of Evil has had serious allegations tabled against it recently, with
tax fraud and embezzlement just some of the financial crimes apparently
committed.

It is speculated that the entrance to the bank was originally located in the
boys showers, however access became an issue in recent months, prompting the
move.
