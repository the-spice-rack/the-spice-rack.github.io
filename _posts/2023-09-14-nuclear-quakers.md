It today has been uncovered by *Unfocused* researcher Kylie van der Walt that
the Religious Society of Friends is manufacturing, harbouring, and distributing
weapons of mass destruction, in order to bump decreasing revenue. After the
failure of the Societyâ€™s last nuclear venture on [Three Mile
Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident), the move from
Philly to Tasmania brought not only a dedicated network of quakers, but also a
myriad of technological knowledge.

Balls deep in the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, as not to upset Bob Brown, the
Society did not propose a new nuclear power station, even after drafting plans
for a nuclear power station to replace the township of Campania, 35 minutes
north east of the meeting house. Instead, they decided to begin a covert
operation of uranium enrichment run out of the basement of the meeting house.
Many are unaware that such a basement exists, however these people have
obviously never poked around in the Boa Vista Room. A small hatch exists in the
BV room, with a hidden staircase leading down to an extensive subterranean
network of high level scientific equipment. 

Welcome to the Headquarters of the Syndicate Involving Quaker Creation of
Ultramodern Nuclear Technology, otherwise known as the shorthand SIQCUNT. 

Registration of the company has been funnelled through a shell company, known as
the Kwaker Trust, with CEO George Washington Walker XXIV proclaimed to be the
richest man in the world who shares a name with a founding father. 

No tax has ever been paid, utilising religious non-profit tax write offs in
order to have billion dollar profits, especially after expanding into the supply
of enriched uranium. This has allowed the quakers to expand into weapons of mass
destruction, although minor moral qualms with this approach have been voiced by
devout friends. 

We do not yet know all the facts. Our Junior Reporter Harvey Lonergan-Sykes has
been sent into the catacombs beneath the Boa Vista room, and we look forward to
welcoming him back with his covert photos and facts early next week.
