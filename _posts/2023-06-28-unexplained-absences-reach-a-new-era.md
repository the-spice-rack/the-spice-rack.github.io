*Unfocused* can report that nearly every student at the school has been skipping
lessons today to buy tickets to Taylor Swift's *Eras* tour. The American artist
is coming to Australia for the first time since 2018. Classrooms around the
school were empty as every student in the school was busy queueing for their
tickets.

"Look, it's an obvious tradeoff" said one student that we spoke to, "The
experience of the lifetime, in exchange for missing one little maths lesson?
Sorry, I definitely know which I'm picking!". The tension in the foyer was
palpable as one student worked her way through the seemingly endless form to buy
the tickets, and the cries of horror when the phone went flat shook the
building.

We at *Unfocused* sought a comment from Adam Chambers, but arrived to find the
'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door. However, we couldn't hear any voices
inside because Taylor Swift's *Bad Blood* was playing at full volume. Sources
have reported that a mysterious new backup dancer is participating in the tour
when in comes to Australia; could it be Adam?

Expect more updates soon.
