In news this week, the student wing of the Rouge International Baccalaureate
Bureau of Education and Training (RIBBETS) has claimed independence of the space
known as the ‘Sanctum’. In a statement, RIBBETS stated that they ‘could no
longer deal with the invasive nature of TCE students into their sacred space’.
‘The new United Socialist Sanctum Republic (USSR) aims to solve this problem,
requiring the presentation of an IB EE draft before entrance’ stated RIBBETS
representative Halifax Jones. 

Concerns have been raised by teaching staff and TCE students alike, with the
Sanctum the only room in the school with anything resembling temperature control
and green life. Sophie Tilyard, a Sanctum frequenter, was visibly distraught at
the prospect of losing the space, with many more people facing similar feelings
of angst regarding the loss of the space. This news comes after three students
were boiled alive in the sweltering heat of the Clemes Library just last week. 

RIBBETS has been contacted for comment, however much of it was returned in
broken and incorrect Spanish.
