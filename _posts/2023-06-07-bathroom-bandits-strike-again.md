Fears are rising that the infamous bathroom bandit crew (BBC) have struck again,
after the Clemes boys' bathroom was found locked today. There has been no
communication from the school on the matter.

Given the incredibly short space between the two incidets, rumours are flying
about what could possibly have happened. Is there a dead body in there? Were a
group of students digging a tunnel to escape Adam's grasp? Were a satanic cult
operating in the stall with no toilet paper? Was it hiding the offices of your
favourite student newspaper? At this stage, nobody knows.

"Who's done this! For fucks' sake!" said a student, who wished to remain
anonymous, after making the trek back from the Farrall Centre bathrooms.

It's currently unclear whether the most recent attack on the bathrooms will lead
to violence. The atmosphere is already shockingly tense; the community is on a
knife edge. It's been feared that another incident could ruin the reputation and
cohesiveness of the school community: could this be the final straw?

Questions abound. Rest assured that if the school does descend into anarchy on
the back of this bathroom vandalism, *Unfocused* will be right by your side, the
guiding light, illuminating that of good in a chaotic world.

### Update

Undercover *Unfocused* journalists uncovered that the bathrooms are fine and
Adam simply forgot to unlock them this morning. Stay safe out there.
