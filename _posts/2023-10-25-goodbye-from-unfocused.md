excerpt: It's been fun.

Although we'd love to be like *Gossip Girl* and follow you for the rest of your
lives, it's time for *Unfocused* to come to an end, for now.

The idea for *Unfocused* came to us after we read about [*The
Oat*](https://www.sidwell.edu/the-oat), from Sidwell Friends' in Washington,
DC, and thought we could do much better than their poor humour.

After a silly meeting in C213, we came up with the absolutely shit name of *The
Spice Rack* (as in SPICEE — yuck!). Thankfully, the much funnier  *Unfocused*
name came to us from an unlikely place — the big man himself, Adam Chambers.

We're very thankful for your readership, and for those of you who submitted
articles. If you're interested in taking up the helm, give us an email at
bstone@unfocused.page (though I'll probably check it once soon then never
again). Thank you to everyone for your kind comments and suggestions, and we're
sorry it's coming to an end.

Matty Gruber, Finley Carrigan Jones, Kylie van der Walt, Harvey Lonergan Sykes
and Günter Polk were played by Lachlan Mackinnon.

Blain Stone was played by Benjamin Stankovich.

Paul T. Geist, Monsieur de Sirloin and Mark 'Tha Moneymaker' Fortescue were
Thomas Wilkins.

Joseph McCrickard was Charlotte Winter and William Bradshaw, although we didn't
know at first. 

Ivan Stirgate was Huxley, which he tried to hide, but Charlotte figured him out.

Thanks to Lachie for buying and running our domain and emails, and for writing
far more than anyone else, and to Ben for building and running the website.

If you want to know about any technical details, as well as the above email, you
can check out the github this is hosted on (linked on the contact page).

Thanks for the good times, everyone.

Yours truly,<br>
Unfocused Big Boss, Polyphemus<br>
Blur Media Group, Inc.
