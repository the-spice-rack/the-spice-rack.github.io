A recent survey by *Unfocused* researcher Kylie van der Walt has revealed that
many of the male staff at the school are avid Roman Empire fanatics. 

Nelson File, Adam Chambers and Jeremy Rackham were all found to be thinking of
the Roman Empire ‘at least once a day’, with many describing the great feats of
engineering and construction as particular highlights. Jez even added a special
comment raving about how deeply infatuated he was with the invention of cement,
saying it was ‘revolutionary’ and ‘life-changing’. 

Other staff members are also heavy Roman fanatics, with Peter Appleton
describing the Romans as ‘pioneers in modern legal practice’, with he thinking
about the Roman Empire even few days. (1-3 times per week). Ben Felstead
considers the Roman Empire at least twice a day, however he noted this has
decreased without a TCE Philosophy class. Sam Norton and Adam Blackburn
marvelled at the immense strength of Caesar and aerobic capacity of Roman
soldiers, however were less enthralled by the entire concept, merely considering
the Roman empire around once a week. Ancient History teacher Mark Allen, an avid
Greek history buff, says he thinks about the empire around 5-10 times per day,
with it understood that in his house he has a poster of Julius Caesar, at which
he throws a dart whenever he gets the opportunity. Greg Downes was another
serial Roman thinker, however refused to elaborate on why this was the case

Surprisingly, Simon Bennett has never considered the Roman Empire, however in
light of this, *Unfocused* have sent him a life-sized cutout of Julius Caesar
playing the saxophone at Eurovision. When asked about the Roman Empire, James
Anderson went on a ginormous rant about how important Emperor Constantine and
the Eastern Roman Empire was to preserving Western civilisation through the dark
ages.

Why all these men are so obsessed is still unclear. Keep your spears sharp, more
to come.
