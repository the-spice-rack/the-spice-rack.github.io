For the first time since his presidential candidacy announcement, school
principal Nelson File has been seen in the hallways of Clemes. Nelson was
spotted on the *Unfocused* 8K CCTV strolling though the Mark Curtis Foyer,
jovial as ever. Greeting students with his customary 'shaka', whispers emerged
as to why Nelson decided to grace the hallowed grounds of the Argyle Street
campus today. This move is considered especially bold considering the recent
Peacewater Horizon tragedy, however Nelson seemed unfazed.

Adam Chambers was spotted hiding in his office, rocking back and forth in the
corner, after spotting Nelson, with the 'Meeting in Progress' sign deployed to
attempt salvation. The relationship between the two is expected to be on full
display next week with both taking the plunge at the FightMND Big Freeze.

More to come.
