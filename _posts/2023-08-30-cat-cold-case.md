As the annual Amnesty Battle of the Bands draws closer, a slip of the tongue
from Clemes head Adam Chambers has drawn unwanted attention from law
enforcement. Adam mentioned the unsolved case of a feline homicide within an
early 2000’s Battle of the Bands, hinting at an involvement in such matters. The
tale of the pussycat passing is redacted from many school records, however
advice provided to the paper says that a cat was stabbed in the mosh by a
selection of students external to the school. A far cry from the tough
regulations placed on current BOTBs, current organiser Kevin James has described
the party nature of the infamous musical battle as ‘aspiration, but
unachievable’.

Quaker Police Chief George Fox (unrelated to the original, and the notorious
Georgie Fox) gave the following statement to our reporter:

“We are investigating the matter, the cat murder of the 00s is the districts
only cold case, however our resources are stretched already in our investigation
into the robbery in Boa Vista and black market sales of Farrall Centre chairs”
(More to come on these soon)

Fox went on to say “Buttons was a stoic cat, one who served nobly in the
protection of the school against rats, however had a bad temper and was known to
bite teachers, especially those wearing fleeces”

Adam strenuously denies the allegations and has launched legal action against
the paper, claiming serious defamation. We don’t care.

More to come.
