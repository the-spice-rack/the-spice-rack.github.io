Year 11 Friends' students are more worried about the 'hell' of sharing a campus
with 'super ratty year 9s' next year than just about anything else you could
possibly imagine, a new poll conducted by our researcher Kylie van der Walt
reveals.

"Look, the school can talk the leg off a donkey about 'teaching' and 'positive
role models'," said a year 11 student who asked to remain anonymous, "but who's
gonna have to do the role modelling? Us! And year 9s suck!"

99% of year 11s listed L@F24+ as their largest cause of anxiety and worry. 80%
said that nightmares about seeing year 9s in the hallways keep them up at night.

The school replied to an official request for comment with an email so long that we
couldn't find anyone at the *Unfocused* office who was willing to read it. Off
the record, a school administrator admitted the main aim of the program was to
"keep people in their place as they go through the unfortunate state of being
15".
