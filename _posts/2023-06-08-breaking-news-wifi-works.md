In a shocking turn of events, it is reported that a Student was able to connect to the Schools internet in a reasonable manner of time. Yvette (name changed for safety) was sitting in Phys Sci when she discovered that upon opening her laptop for the first time in an hour, she was connected to the internet. 


Chaos ensued, with many gathering around the laptop to witness the moment, seen comparable in monumentality to the birth of Christ. While educator Sumone Simmers set off the emergency confetti kept under the desk in C117, American Authors' smash hit ‘Best Day of my Life’ played from a large bluetooth speaker concealed in the ceiling. 


The ruckus could be heard from the *Unfocused* offices, with office intern Harvey Lonergan-Sykes sent to ensure the noise was not the explosion of our printing presses. 


It is understood the King’s Birthday public holiday has been renamed to commemorate the occasion , with many planning illegal fireworks and raging warehouse parties over the long weekend. 


The Friends Union of Clemes Control and Internet Technology  (FUCC IT) are extremely pissed off, with senior management involved to rectify the blunder. *Unfocused* is aware of ongoing discussions with IT staff as to how this could have possibly happened, with whispers of layoffs increasing. We understand that The Friends’ Schools’ Director of Money, Opulence, Overcharging, Laundering, and Hedge-funds (MOOLAH) was awoken from their eternal slumber to authorise an outgoing payment concerning matters other than marimbas and rowing, a full ride scholarship to Yvette on the basis of technological wizardry. 


As a result of the unexpected payment, the school is expected to launch another round of their infamous donation drive next week. Rich parents are expected to donate on a record scale in order to write off a significant portion of their tax, and ensure their darling children receive the highest standard of education, but mostly just for tax reasons. 


We did attempt to get in touch with students over video link, however most reported issues with internet connectivity or dropped out mid meeting.
