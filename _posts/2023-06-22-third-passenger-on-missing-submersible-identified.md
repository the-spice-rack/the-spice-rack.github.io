It has been confirmed that alongside a billionaire and a boat captain, the third
passenger on the missing Titan submarine is notorious German teacher and serial
substitute teacher Sylvia. After going on leave from the school a week or two
ago to travel to 'Germany', Sylvia is understood to have flown to Newfoundland
in order to see the wreckage of the Titanic. A departure from her usual 'sub'
duties, Sylvia does not know how to use a crusty old gaming controller as was
being used to pilot the submarine, bringing into question the likelihood of a
happy ending to this undersea mishap. *Unfocused* sends their support to the
families during this trying time.
