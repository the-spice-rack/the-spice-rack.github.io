In a shocking turn of events, everybody has forgotten about the *Speak Up, Stay
ChatTY* Shorts Day. Shorts day is a fundraising event, held on the shortest day
of the year, encouraging people to 'brave the cold' to promote conversation
surrounding mental health. My study shows that there are actually more students
taking the IB than wearing shorts today, with notable teaching and
administration staff not 'braving the cold'. Nelson File, Adam Chambers, Amy
Harris and Kate Baldry have all been spotted well within their comfortable long
pants, clearly supporting the message of mental health conversation, as usual.

The *Unfocused* team broke out the panel heaters this morning, with Blain Stone,
Matty Gruber, Monsieur de Sirloin, Finley Carrigan-Jones, Paul T.  Geist, office
intern Harvey Lonergan-Sykes and myself all braving the cold in shorts, with
some more questionable than others.

 More to come. KVDW out.
