New data obtained by *Unfocused* show the most popular cars driven by Friends
students.

## 1. Volkswagen Golf

Newer models are a favourite amongst wheel-curbing inner southern suburbs girls,
the study suggesting that most Golfs adorned with Red P's parked near the school
are registered to fathers in Sandy Bay or Battery Point. Contrastingly, older
models seem popular with boys when daddy’s money couldn’t quite stretch to the
Tiguan, especially notable when accessorised with roof rails and bike racks. 

## 2. Subaru Forester

Popular with the outdoorsy type, or those wanting to be the outdoorsy type.
Newer, clean cars seen, however base models from the older shape, often with
‘tasteful’ aftermarket wheels, are more common, and we advise readers to avoid
these examples. 

## 3. Volkswagen Polo

For those not at Golf level of basic, or income, yet still looking to fit in.
Often grey, yet the occasional GTI hints at an excellent tax return from daddy
last year.
