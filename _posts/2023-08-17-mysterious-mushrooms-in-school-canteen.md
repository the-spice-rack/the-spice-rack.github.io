A new special has been sighted in the Clemes Canteen, with mushroom risotto
emerging as a special for Term 3 and a half, with questions raised over the
“home-grown” nature of the produce. The product description states that the
mushroom were grown in the garden of canteen curator Virgil Llewellyn, an
eclectic and somewhat spacey foodie.

No side-effects have yet been reported, however other shroom stories have
emerged with evidence of psychedelic fungi found in the Peace Garden.

More to come.
