After the infamous ‘mid-year’ exams that were held 2/3 of the way through the
calendar year, students have been treated to a similarly ‘mid-week’ start.
"Thursday is the new Monday" according to Adam Chambers, with the Friday
round-up reported to be a "real juicy one" this week. General consensus gathered
from schoolyard reporter and new intern Jacob Zelenskyy (no relation to friend
of the paper, Vlad) was that coming back to school was awful, once described as
“f\*cking terrible” with the student expressing their desires for whoever made
this decision to “choke on their weetbix”. Oddly specific, but we can only
report the news.

Until next time.
