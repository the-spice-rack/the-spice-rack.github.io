Keen gamblers have discovered that a new category has opened up in the Friends’
School multi. 

How many of the chairs does Brandon have ready for Gathering?

Current odds for this Fridays gathering sit at:

None:  $3.54

1-25%:  $1.98

25-50%:  $1.34

50-75%:  $1.45

75-99%: $1.78

Fully set up:  $2.43

Other items in the Friends’ same-gathering multi include:

Number of knuckle cracks 

Windows open (Yes/No)

Nelson to attend (Yes/No)

Allegations of match fixing have also been tabled, with Brandon apparently a
serial sportsbetter, creating worrying fears that no chairs will be set up this
Friday. 

Hope you’ve got your standing legs ready. Adam Chambers outburst incoming.
