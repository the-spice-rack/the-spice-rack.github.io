Nelson File has just announced that he wants his next job to be President of the
United States of America. It was rumoured that after his snooze in Gathering
last week, he thought 'Sleepy Nelson' had quite the ring to it. Nelson’s party
affiliation is currently unknown. The Quaker Party of America has not yet named
their candidate, however it seems unlikely that Nelson would pick such a minor
party. The Democrats are a more likely option; Joe Biden was performing key
presidential duties (asleep) when we asked for comment. During his launch party,
Nelson was said to have given the ’shaka’ to everyone when asked for policy
positions, leading to questions as to whether he is campaigning for Hawaiian
secession from the United States. His running mate has not yet been announced,
but rumours are swirling. Expect updates soon.
